    "event_description": "Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan proposed ending presidential pardons after Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, former Binance CEO convicted of facilitating money laundering who had invested in Trump's family crypto venture. Slotkin criticized pardons by both parties, stating the power \"doesn't make sense in the modern world.\"\n\nThe proposal divided Democrats, with House Judiciary Committee members split on whether to eliminate or reform clemency powers. Trump's broader pardon actions last week included dozens of allies involved in challenging 2020 election results and January 6 Capitol participants, reigniting debates about presidential clemency authority.",

The network featured Michigan officials warning about threats to democratic institutions and highlighted how the pardons were already encouraging conspiracy theories among state Republicans.\n\nFox concentrated on the political divisions within the Democratic Party over Slotkin's proposal to eliminate presidential pardons. The coverage emphasized legislative debates about clemency reform, featuring Democrats arguing both for abolishing the power and preserving it as an essential check on the justice system."
